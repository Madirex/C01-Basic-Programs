# C01  Simple C Scripts
- ex00 (ft_ft) -> Takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter.
- ex01 (ft_ultimate_ft) -> Takes a pointer to a pointer to a pointer... to an integer.
- ex02 (ft_swap) -> Takes two integer pointers as parameters and swaps the values they point to.
- ex03 (ft_div_mod) -> Takes two integers a and b, calculates their division and remainder, and stores the results in the provided memory locations pointed to by div and mod.
- ex04 (ft_ultimate_div_mod) -> Takes two integer pointers a and b, calculates their division and remainder, and updates the values they point to with the quotient and remainder, respectively.
- ex05 (ft_putstr) -> Takes a pointer to a character (char *str) and prints the string it points to.
- ex06 (ft_strlen) -> Calculate the length of the string.
- ex07 (ft_rev_int_tab) -> Takes an array of integers (int *tab) and its size (int size). It reverses the order of the elements in the array by swapping elements from the beginning to the end.
- ex08 (ft_sort_int_tab) -> Implements the insertion sort algorithm.
